# Unofficial CVR-CCK

Official CCK available here: https://cck.cvr.gg/

# **WARNING: This is unofficial.**
#### I have the permission to work on the CCK and provide the changes to the ChilloutVR Developers
In the future this repo might be shut down or just kept for archival reasons.

I will never add any malicious features. That is neither wanted by the ChilloutVR Developers nor necessary in any way.

This is purely for convenience features for the existing functionality

If you have ideas on what could be added then you can ask that via the issues and I might make it and/or bring it up with the ChilloutVR Developers.

This modified version of the ChilloutVR Content Creation Kit has:
- foldouts on advanced avatar lists
- use Animation Clip option on some places in those lists
- destination state toggle for GameObject Dropdowns
- no warnings (deprecated things fixed, otherwise warnings disabled)

#### These changes will probably be incorporated into the official CCK by early 2021, for the time being you can make use of them via this replacement CCK.
