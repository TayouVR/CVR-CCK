# Unofficial CVR-CCK

Official CCK available here: https://cck.cvr.gg/

## This modification is unofficial and not supported by Alpha Blend Interactive. Using this modification might cause issues with performance, security or stability of the games.
(Following [ABI TOS](https://documentation.abinteractive.net/official/legal/tos/#for-mods))

This repo is purely for convenience features for the existing functionality

If you have ideas on what could be added then you can ask that via the issues and I might make it and/or bring it up with the ChilloutVR Developers. 
However they are working on a proper feedback board right now, so that really shouldn't be necessary.

### TODO
- overhaul slider inputs to be able to 
  - use one animationClip with Interpolate Time rather than using a blendtree
  - support more than two animations per blendtree and support custom positions in the blendtree (like in the animator window)

### 30/08/2022
- allow multiple animation clips per option
